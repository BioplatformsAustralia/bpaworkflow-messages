Help information for BPA Workflow error messages

## Concept

Inspired by https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/rules/default_rules.html the
BPA Workflow and BPA Ingest codebases flag an error code (eg E2001) in the
error messages they emit.  The BPA Workflow frontend parses the error messages
and converts them to a hyperlink to help documentation that is part
of this repository and hosted on Github pages.

## List of error messages

See https://bioplatformsaustralia.github.io/bpaworkflow-messages/Overview

## Work in Progress

Please note that this documentation and help repository is still under
development.  Any questions should be directed to the Bioplatforms Australia
team.
